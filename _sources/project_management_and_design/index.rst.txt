Project Management and Design
=============================

This section explains how SimpleAppState’s design
supports **team-based development**.

These chapters focus not on how to write widgets,
but on how to **structure responsibility, ownership,
and performance** across a codebase when multiple people
work on the same application.

They are especially useful for architects, tech leads,
and anyone responsible for keeping a large project
maintainable over time.
