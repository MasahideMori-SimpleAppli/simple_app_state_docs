Definitions of terms used throughout the documentation.

StateSlot
----------------------------

A typed handle to a single piece of application state.
Each slot has a fixed type and name, and all reads and writes go through it.
Slots are used as the unit of change detection and notification.

SimpleAppState
----------------------------

A container that holds all StateSlots and their values.
It manages updates, batching, listeners, cloning, and serialization.
Applications typically have one or a few instances of this class.

Batch
----------------------------

A mechanism that groups multiple state updates into a single commit.
Values are updated immediately, but listener notifications are delayed and merged.
This is mainly used to avoid redundant UI updates and commits.

Listener
----------------------------

A callback that is triggered when state changes occur.
There are multiple kinds of listeners: UI listeners (per subscriber),
debug listeners (called on every change), and state listeners (called on commit).
Listeners react to changes but do not modify state directly.

Commit
----------------------------

The moment when state changes are considered finalized.
A commit happens after a non-batch update or when a batch finishes.
State listeners are notified at this point, making it suitable for undo/redo logic.
