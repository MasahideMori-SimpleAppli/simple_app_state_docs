Persistence and Restore
======================================

This section describes how **SimpleAppState** supports persistence and restore.

----

Overview
========

Persistence in **SimpleAppState** is based on dictionary serialization.

* The entire application state is converted into a JSON-compatible dictionary.
* The state can later be restored by reconstructing objects from that dictionary.

This mechanism relies on:

* ``toDict()`` for serialization
* ``fromDict(...)`` for restoration

----

Serialization with toDict
=========================

**SimpleAppState** implements ``toDict()``, which converts the internal state
into a dictionary.

The returned dictionary follows strict rules:

* Only primitive types, ``null``, lists, and dictionaries are allowed
* Nested dictionaries must also follow the same constraints
* Runtime objects are not included

Objects stored inside the state that extend ``CloneableFile`` must embed
their class identity in the serialized form, typically using:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "className": "MyObject",
   }

This allows the object to be restored later.

----

Restoring State with fromDict
=============================

Restoration is performed using the factory constructor
``SimpleAppState.fromDict``.

Unlike ``toDict()``, restoration requires **external knowledge** about
how to reconstruct each serialized object.

.. code-block:: python

   app_state = SimpleAppState.fromDict(
       data,
       fromDictMap,
   )

The ``fromDictMap`` parameter defines how objects are restored.

fromDictMap
-----------

``fromDictMap`` is a mapping from object names to restoration functions.

* The key is the object name
* It must match the value written as ``"className"`` during serialization
* The value is a function that restores the object from a dictionary

Example:

.. code-block:: python

   fromDictMap = {
       "MyObject": MyObject.fromDict,
       "AnotherObject": AnotherObject.fromDict,
   }

When a dictionary containing a matching ``className`` field is found,
the corresponding restoration function is used.

----

Internal Restoration Process
============================

Internally, ``SimpleAppState.fromDict`` performs the following steps:

1. Extract serialized state data from the dictionary
2. Traverse the data structure recursively
3. When a dictionary with a ``className`` field is encountered:
   * Look up the corresponding function in ``fromDictMap``
   * Restore the object using that function
4. Reconstruct the application state using the restored objects

This logic is implemented using a utility function and is fully deterministic.
By requiring restoration logic to be provided explicitly via ``fromDictMap``,
**SimpleAppState** keeps persistence flexible and avoids hard-coded
dependencies on concrete object types.
