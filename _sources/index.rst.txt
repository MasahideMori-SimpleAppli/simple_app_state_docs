SimpleAppState Documentation
============================

SimpleAppState is a state-first state management library for Flutter.

This is designed for teams where not everyone is a state-management expert,
prioritizing explicit ownership and misuse-resistant APIs
to keep state behavior predictable and easy to reason about.

This documentation explains not only how to use the package,
but also the design principles and trade-offs behind it.

If you are new to SimpleAppState, start with *Getting Started*.
If you want to understand the design philosophy, read *Core Concepts*.
