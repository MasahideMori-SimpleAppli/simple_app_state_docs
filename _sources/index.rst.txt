SimpleAppState Documentation
============================

SimpleAppState is a state-first state management library for Flutter.

SimpleAppState is designed for teams where not everyone is a state-management expert,
prioritizing explicit ownership and misuse-resistant APIs over flexibility.

This documentation explains not only how to use the package,
but also why it is designed this way.

If you are new to SimpleAppState, start with *Getting Started*.
If you want to understand the design philosophy, read *Core Concepts*.
